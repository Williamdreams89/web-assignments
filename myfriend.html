        <h2>About Benjamin</h2>
        <img src="./assets/img/gradcap.png" class="profile_watermark" />
        <p>
          Benjamin Attakumah is currently serving as the Health Information
          Management Students Association president. He has been a dear friend,
          brother, and study partner of mine throughout my entire undergraduate
          years. I have had the pleasure of knowing him since our freshman year,
          and throughout that time, he has continuously displayed exceptional
          leadership skills, a passion for community service, and a strong
          commitment to his academic pursuits.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a friend, Benjamin has always been dependable and trustworthy, and
          he has been there for me through the ups and downs of college life. He
          has a great sense of humor and a positive attitude that always makes
          those around him feel at ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to his role as the HIMSA president, Benjamin has been
          actively involved in several community service initiatives on and
          off-campus, including volunteering at local hospitals and
          participating in health outreach programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Benjamin is also an exceptional student, consistently earning high
          grades and receiving recognition for his academic achievements. He is
          always willing to lend a helping hand to his fellow students and is an
          excellent study partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, Benjamin is an outstanding individual, and I am grateful to
          have him as a friend and colleague. I have no doubt that he will
          continue to achieve great things in his personal and professional
          life.
